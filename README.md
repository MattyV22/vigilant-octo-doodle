i created a static website through amazon s3 bucket following a step by step.
no credit goes to me.
this quick 8 min video was supposed to be a quick and easy project to get me started but i ran into a problem... kinda.
i had to access the metadata within my bucket and configure from text/plain to text/html as i was veiwing the static website in raw html.
i added text/html, opened the URL linked and boom the web page rendered 
i also lenrt that amazon s3 looks for index.html by defaul as the home page so someone where along my learning i missed that important key
all steps in the video were easy to follow but i enmcountered this issue where it was only in Raw html.

One day i will create my own step by step and paste it beleow
